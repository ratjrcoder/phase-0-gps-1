# Reflection GPS 1.1
### Gabriela Alessio


1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

... Parts of the workflow were still a bit “blurry” to me, very simple things like not getting a pull request because I made a change on the master branch instead of a feature branch, or merging directly in Github for a peer. Overall it helped me understand the workflow and it now makes perfect sense.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

... Merging with small conflicts, and a few new commands to work faster.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

... A ton, primarily on command abbreviations and workflow structures on git and Github.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

... After 1 hr of GPS and 2 extra hrs of pairing for this exercise, I’m good (because of all the mistakes I made and had to fix). The only thing I still struggle with is having identical repo names which, if we're pairing and we already have a repo named like the other person, then we have to be super careful not to confuse them.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

... It was awesome! Regina and Ralph were great to work with.
