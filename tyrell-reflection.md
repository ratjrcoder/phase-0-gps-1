_What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?_
I felt very comfortable on the Git or local side: work-flow, branching, syntax. However, I struggled with basically every thing on the GitHub side. It is completely new. I guess the biggest challenge was becoming familiar with the interface and knowing where to go, for basically everything.

_What concepts were clarified during the GPS?_
I have a better understanding of pushing and pulling. I know how to track a commit through GitHub. 

_What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?_
Most of my questions dealt with navigating GitHub. I asked about pull vs. fetch. Working on branches. I also had questions regarding Sublime.

_What still confuses you about Git?_
Git is still not familiar to me. For example, today working to complete this challenge, my partner and I went struggled to figure out an error message as we tried to pull the latest version of the repo. Finally, we discovered that we on the master branch and once we switched to the correct feature branch the issue was resolved. Another issue came up as I attempted to close out the exercise in the Release 7. Again I tried to pull down the lates repo and discovered there was a merge conflict. I kind of like merge conflicts because the help me to figure out what went wrong. What most confuses me about GitHub is that, clearly it is merely a tool. However, getting it right--an absolute must--is a major time suck. 

_How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?_
My first GPS was fantastic. I was was pair with Regina Copeland. She was great about letting us work through issues and even greater at stepping in before we ran too far down rabbit holes. She also provided helpful tips and best practices.
